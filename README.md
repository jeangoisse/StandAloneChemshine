VFE Settlers Chemshine Stand Alone Edition for Rimworld 1.5, initially a demand by Aussie.

Debloated VFE-S to keep only the chemshine and it's production chain. Includes the custom hediff "Chemshined". I had to kept one of the Assembly file because otherwise Chemshine is considered as any other alcohol by the game, without custom effects.
